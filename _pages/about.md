My name is Jordan and I'm a PhD candidte in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon advised by [Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com) and [Sarah Fox](https://www.sarahfox.info/). I graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.

My research focuses on how queer communities negotiate the values embedded within sociotechnical systems, such such as online communities and generative AI models. I also examine how technologists' understandings of marginalized communities shapes the design and research of sociotechnical systems. 

**I am on the job market looking for postdoctorate, tenure track, or industry research positions!**

**Research Interests**: Critical HCI, Science & Technology Studies, Queer HCI, Social Computing, Responsible AI
