My name is Jordan (he/him) and I'm a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon advised by [Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com) and [Sarah Fox](https://www.sarahfox.info/). I graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.

My research focuses on the values embedded within sociotechnical systems — such as online communities and generative AI models — as well as how members of marginalized communities negotiate these values. At the same time, I am interested in how the design of technology is mediated by the ways researchers and practitioners understand marginalized communities.

**Research Interests**: Critical HCI, Science & Technology Studies, Queer HCI, Social Computing, Responsible AI
