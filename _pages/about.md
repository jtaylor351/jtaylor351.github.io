My name is Jordan (he/him) and I'm a second-year PhD student in Human Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon advised by [Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com).

Before CMU, I graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I worked with [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) in the [Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of social computing, culture, and marginalized communities (particularly LGBTQ+ and fat communities).

I'm broadly interested in the social construction of knowledge by (e.g., in online communities) and about (e.g., in academia or data schemas) marginalized groups. 

I don't upadte this site very often, so if you want to see what I'm up to I'm fairly active on both <a href="https://twitter.com/nprandchill">Twitter</a> (for now) and on <a rel="me" href="https://hci.social/@jordant">Mastodon</a>

**Research Interests**: Social Computing, Science & Technology Studies, Critical Data Studies, Identity, Marginalized Communities, Feminism, Queer Theory, Postcolonial Studies, & Fat Studies

**Methods**: Human-Centered Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Interviews, & Participant Observation

**Hobbies**: Running, Hiking, Vegetarian Cooking, & Punk Music
