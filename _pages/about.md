My name is Jordan (he/him) and I'm a second-year PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon advised by [Haiyi Zhu](https://haiyizhu.com) and [Sarah Fox](https://www.sarahfox.info/).

Before CMU, I graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, where I worked with [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/) in the [Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of social computing, culture, and marginalized communities (particularly LGBTQ+ and fat communities).

I'm broadly interested in the social construction of knowledge by (e.g., in online communities) and about (e.g., in academia or data schemas) marginalized groups. I'm also interested in the impact of "marginalization" as a growing discourse within computing.

**Research Interests**: Social Computing, Science & Technology Studies, Critical Data Studies, Identity, Marginalized Communities, Feminism, Queer Theory, Postcolonial Studies, & Fat Studies

**Methods**: Human-Centered Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Interviews, & Participant Observation
